I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements, even though the classes were defined in my `tailwind.config.js` file and I correctly imported the CSS file into my HTML file.  The issue only occurred on certain elements while others worked perfectly fine. The browser's developer console didn't show any specific errors related to Tailwind.
