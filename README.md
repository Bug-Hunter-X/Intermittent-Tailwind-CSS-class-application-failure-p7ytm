# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are intermittently applied to HTML elements.  Some elements correctly render the Tailwind styles, while others do not, despite seemingly identical class application.  The issue is not immediately apparent in the browser's developer console.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe that some elements have Tailwind styles applied (e.g., the paragraph with the `p-4` class), while others do not (e.g., the div with the `bg-blue-500` class).  The behavior is inconsistent. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Tailwind directives in your `tailwind.config.js` file correctly include all your components and that your CSS is properly imported and compiled (using a build process such as Vite or Webpack). Review the `bugSolution.html` for a corrected implementation.
